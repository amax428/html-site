            <h1>STGO's mission is to bring transportation — <br>for everyone, everywhere.</h1><br><br>
            <h3>We were founded in 2009 to solve an important problem: how do you get a ride at the push of a button? More than five billion trips later, we've started tackling even greater challenges: making transportation safer with self-driving cars, delivering food quickly and affordably with STGO Eats, and reducing congestion in cities by getting more people into fewer cars.</h3><br><br><br>

                <h2>Hit the road faster with Saved Places</h2>
    Bookmark addresses, so you can get to the people and places you need to see faster. Your office. Your best friend’s place. Your favorite coffee shop. These are places you go to time and time again. Save these addresses to your STGO app and get on your way a lot faster. Once you’ve saved a place, the option will be available as a shortcut every time you ride.
    Why it's helpful
    Get there faster
    With Saved Places, you’ll be one tap away from where you want to be. Plus, it’s easier than saving a contact to your phone.
    Save it and forget it
    Finally, there’s no need to remember the name or address of a place. Save it once and make it easier anytime you want to go there.

            <div class="know-before-you-go">
                <h2>Know before you go</h2> 
    Enter a destination to see the price before you ride. Sharing an STGO with friends? Choose 'Split Fare' as you ride to share the cost with them too. You know how much your airline ticket costs before you take off, so why should your ride be any different? Upfront pricing makes riding simpler, while giving you control over how much you spend. There’s no complicated math and no surprises—so you can sit back and enjoy the ride.
    Why it's helpful
    Get a real-time price
    The same way you know the price when booking a flight or hotel, know how much your ride will cost before you hit the road.
    Compare your options
    Know which option best fits your needs—and your wallet.

                <h2>Because sharing is caring</h2>
                Skip the surprise entrance, and let your friends, family, or co-workers know when to expect you. You can easily share your status so that they can follow your ride in real time. Let friends and family follow along with your ride, so they know when to expect you.
